Pop star Britney Spears and her husband Sam Asghari have split up after 14 months of marriage.

A divorce petition filed late on Wednesday, seen by BBC News, cites "irreconcilable differences" between Asghari, 29, and Spears, 41.

The couple got engaged in September 2021 and were married in a small but star-studded ceremony in June 2022.

But rumours of their marital struggles have been splashed across US tabloids this year.

Representatives for Spears and Asghari have not yet commented.

The musician did not address the divorce in a Wednesday night post to her 42 million Instagram followers, instead writing that she was "buying a horse soon".

According to the dissolution of marriage petition filed by Asghari in Los Angeles County Superior Court, he asks that spousal support and attorneys' fees be paid by Spears.

The Iranian-American actor, model and fitness trainer met Spears while she was shooting the video for her song, Slumber Party, in 2016.

He played a key role during her conservatorship fight with father Jamie, sporting a Free Britney T-shirt on Instagram before a crucial court hearing.

                <p>Two Belarusian poems from the 19th Century have been declared "extremist", in a sign of an expanding crackdown on criticism of the authorities.

                    Vincent Dunin-Martsinkevich's poems relate to a nationalist uprising against the Russian Empire.
                    
                    Authoritarian Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko has tightened his grip on power since elections in 2020 which were widely considered to be rigged.
                    
                    He has since provided support for Russia in its invasion of Ukraine.
                    
                    Experts described the banning of the poems as part of a transition to totalitarianism, as many opponents of the regime are nationalists who dislike Mr Lukashenko's pro-Russian stance.
                    
                    Most have now fled the country or are in jail.

                    An announcement by the prosecutor's office in the capital Minsk on Thursday said that the two poems, The Winds are Floating and Conversation of an Elderly Man, along with a foreword to the author's collected works by literary critic Yazep Yanushkevich, had been declared "extremist material".
                    
                    The poems were written during the Kastus Kalinowski rebellion of 1863 by Belarusians and Poles in what was then Poland and a part of the Russian Empire.
                    
                    Dunin-Martsinkevich was at the time accused of disseminating ideas "harmful for the authorities".
                    
                    He was arrested and incarcerated, but his direct participation in the uprising was never proven.
                    
                    Today his works are part of the school curriculum and his plays are performed regularly. He has several streets named after him and he is celebrated in his home town of Bobruisk, in the south-east of Belarus.
                    
                    The independent outlet Nexta said that books by several 20th Century authors - Larisa Geniyush, Vladimir Neklyayev, Lidiya Arobey and Natalya Arseneva - had also been banned.</p></td>
